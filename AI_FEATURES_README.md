## üîß Technical Implementation

1. Hugging Face Integration
HF_API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
Uses DistilBERT for sentiment analysis
Detects urgency level in student requests
Free tier available (no API key required for basic usage)

2. AI Matching Algorithm

def calculate_compatibility_score(student_text, tutor_expertise, student_sentiment):
    # Subject matching (40% weight)
    # Keyword overlap (20% weight)  
    # Text similarity (20% weight)
    # Urgency factor (20% weight)
    return compatibility_score

3. Subject Detection

7 main subject categories with 50+ keywords

Mathematics, Science, English, Programming, History, Languages, Arts
Partial matching and fuzzy detection
Real-time API endpoint for suggestions

## üìä Database Enhancements
New Columns Added

-- Tutors table
ALTER TABLE tutors ADD COLUMN subject_tags TEXT DEFAULT '';

-- Students table  
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN subject_tags TEXT DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN compatibility_score DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00;
Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_tutors_subject_tags ON tutors(subject_tags);
CREATE INDEX idx_students_subject_tags ON students(subject_tags);
CREATE INDEX idx_students_compatibility_score ON students(compatibility_score);

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. Update Database Schema
# Run the database updates
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < database_updates.sql

2. Configure Hugging Face API (Optional)
# In config.py, add (optional for enhanced features):
